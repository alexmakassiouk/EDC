    "As you learned in this weeks lecture, the traditional cobweb model describe a dynamic price adjustment process for a single non-storable good with a supply response lag.\n",
    "In this exercise we will explore an extension of model in which producers may chose which of two market to sell in. In this extended model the decision to enter one of two markets is repeated in every period. Specifically and is based on the profits of the preceding period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self study is structured as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We look at this model assuming there is no interaction between the two markets and derive the price update rule.\n",
    "2. We introduce the idea that firms can chose which market to sell in based on the profits of the preceding period.\n",
    "3. Finally, given this update rule we will simulate the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Changes from Lecture:**\n",
    "For notation simplicity I will use $i$ to denote either of the two markets, and $j$ to denote the other.\n",
    "So for example the share of suppliers in market $i$ is $W_{it}$ and that of $j$ is $W_{jt} = 1- W_{it}$.\n",
    "Also unlike in the lecture I will assume that $N=1$; this has no effect on the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In each period the market clears, which means that demand and equals supply weighted by the share of suppliers in each market,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_{it} = W_{it} S_{it} \\qquad \\forall i \\in \\{X,Y\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the basic cobweb model, we assume that the supply response is lagged.\n",
    "In other words supply in market $i$ at $t$ depends on the price observed in the previous period $P_{it-1}$ and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{it} = \\frac{P_{it-1}-c_i}{d_i}\n",
